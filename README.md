# HostelBuddie - Under Progress

HostelBuddie is a portal application designed to address various hostel-related issues. 
The project aims to provide features such as roommate finder using machine learning algorithms, lost-and-found portals, and buy/sell platforms for academic materials.

## Features

1. **Roommate Matching Framework**: This feature is especially useful for first-year students, as they often struggle to find compatible roommates initially. Through a form, students can select their traits,interests and  preferences. Machine learning algorithms will be used to match students with individuals of similar personalities or interests.

2. **Lost-and-Found Portal**: If someone loses an item, they can post about it here. This feature will bridge the gap in communication across different years and branches, ensuring important information reaches everyone effectively.

3. **Buy/Sell Portal for Notes and Supplies**: A dedicated platform where students can buy or sell academic materials such as notes, lab coats, or drafting tools. This feature will be particularly beneficial for inter-year use, connecting those looking to sell items with those who need them but otherwise wouldn't know who to contact.
